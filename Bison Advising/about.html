                <h1>ABOUT BISON ADVISING</h1>
                <p>Undergraduate academic advising at Howard University encounters significant challenges in delivering personalized guidance to a diverse student body. The traditional advising model, while well-intentioned, grapples with inefficiencies and lacks the integration of contemporary technological advancements. Recognizing these limitations, this document proposes the implementation of an innovative Undergraduate Advising Assistant, leveraging generative AI technology to revolutionize the advising process.</p>
                <p>The primary purpose of the proposed system is to streamline and enhance the academic advising experience for students, advisors, and institutions alike. With a multifaceted approach, it aims to personalize advising recommendations for each student, providing 24/7 on-demand support. Through the automation of routine advising tasks, the system seeks to increase efficiency, allowing advisors to focus on more nuanced aspects of student support. Additionally, the AI technology is designed to identify at-risk students, enabling proactive interventions and timely assistance.</p>
                <p>The system is tailored to meet the diverse needs of its users. For students, the objectives encompass receiving personalized academic guidance, accessing on-demand support, and making informed decisions about their education. The intuitive interface facilitates actions such as logging into their accounts, planning their academic journey, receiving reminders, and obtaining academic scheduling based on their interests. Both advisors and students can collaboratively modify checklists, ensuring a dynamic and responsive advising process.</p>
                <p>Academic advisors, on the other hand, stand to benefit from an enhanced advising quality, time savings on routine tasks, and improved identification of students in need of support. The system empowers advisors to enforce academic policies effectively and dedicate more time to meaningful interactions with students.</p>
